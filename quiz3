2.Question 2
In each of the given situations a company is in one of the five phases of the “Path to ML”.

Identify the phase of each of tasks by writing

I for individual contributor

D for delegation

Z for digitization

B for big data and analytics

M for machine learning

___ All tasks (execution of process, choosing operational parameters, and feedback of parameters) are fully automated

___ A person performs the task and instructions to complete the task are passed from person to person

___ A computer executes the process and a software engineer ensures the parameters are part of the feedback loop. Parameters are chosen through analysis of historical patterns

___ A computer executes the process but a person supplies the parameters via a graphical user interface

___ A task is completed by a group of people
