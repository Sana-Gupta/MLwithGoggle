How Google does Machine Learning

1.Question 1
What is a common reason for an ML model that works well in training but fails in production?
Answer:
The ML dataset was improperly created

2.Question 2
Personalized Algorithms are often built using which type of ML model?
Answer:
Recommendation systems
Explanation:
Recommendation systems is the correct answer. But you must understand and know the tools and tricks of image processing and sequence systems to understand recommendation systems.

3.Question 3
What is a key lesson Google has learned with regards to reducing the chance of failure in production ML models?
Answer:
Process batch data and streaming data the same way
Explanation:
Make sure batch data and streaming data are processed the same way. If we do this then the training data (batch data) and the streaming data are more likely to be compatible, which improves the chances of a successful serving of the model
